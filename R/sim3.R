#' Simulated data set 3
#'
#' The simulated data set \code{sim3} considers a setting with 2000 observations from a logistic
#' regression model. The number and types of predictors, the regression effects and the level probabilites
#' of the predictors are the same as for \code{sim1}. The number of observations was increased as the uncertainty
#' is usually higher for logistic regression compared to linear regression with normal response.
