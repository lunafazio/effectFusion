#' Bayesian effect fusion for categorical predictors
#'
#' @description This function performs Bayesian variable selection and effect fusion for
#' categorical predictors in linear and logistic regression models. Effect fusion aims at the question which
#' categories of an ordinal or nominal predictor have a similar effect on the response and therefore
#' can be fused to obtain a sparser representation of the model. Effect fusion and variable selection
#' can be obtained either with a prior that has an interpretation as spike and slab prior on the
#' level effect differences or with a sparse finite mixture prior on the level effects. The
#' regression coefficients are estimated with a flat uninformative prior after model selection or
#' by using model averaged results. For posterior inference, a MCMC sampling scheme is used that involves only
#' Gibbs sampling steps. The sampling schemes for linear and logistic regression are almost identical as
#' in the case of logistic regression a data augmentation strategy (Polson et al. (2013)) is used that requires
#' only one additional step to sample from the Polya-Gamma distribution.
#'
#' @param y a vector of the response observations (continuous if \code{family =} \code{'gaussian'} and 0/1 if \code{family =} \code{'binomial'})
#' @param X a data frame with covariates, each column representing one covariate. Ordinal and nominal covariates should
#' be of class \code{factor}
#' @param types a character vector to specify the type of each covariate; 'c' indicates continuous or metric predictors, 'o'
#' ordinal predictors and 'n' nominal predictors
#' @param method controls the main prior structure that is used for effect fusion. For the prior
#' that has an interpretation as spike and slab prior on the level effect differences choose \code{method =} \code{'SpikeSlab'}
#' and for the sparse finite mixture prior on the level effects choose \code{method =} \code{'FinMix'}. See
#' details for a description of the two approaches and their advantages and drawbacks. For comparison purposes
#' it is also possible to fit a full model without performing any effect fusion (\code{method =} \code{NULL})
#' @param prior an (optional) list of prior settings and hyper-parameters for the prior (see details).
#' The specification of this list depends on the chosen \code{method} and the selected \code{family}
#' @param iter number of MCMC iterations, including the warmup (default 25000 for effect
#' fusion models and 4000 for full models)
#' @param warmup number of MCMC iterations discarded as warmup (default 5000 for effect
#' fusion models and 1000 for full models)
#' @param thin period for saving draws (default 1, which keeps every draw).
#' @param startsel number of MCMC iterations drawn from the model before effect fusion
#' starts (default 1000 for effect fusion models and 0 for full models). Must not exceed
#' \code{warmup}.
#' @param refit an (optional) list of MCMC settings for the refit of the selected model, with
#' the elements \code{iter}, \code{warmup} and \code{thin} (default
#' \code{list(iter =} \code{4000,} \code{warmup =} \code{1000,} \code{thin =} \code{1)}).
#' It is not used if \code{modelSelection} or \code{method} is \code{NULL}.
#' @param save_warmup if \code{TRUE} (default \code{FALSE}) the object also returns the
#' warmup draws in \code{draws_warmup}. This can be used to check convergence. The warmup
#' draws do not influence the results of \code{\link{dic}}, \code{\link{model}},
#' \code{\link{plot}}, \code{\link{print}} and \code{\link{summary}}.
#' @param family indicates whether linear (default, \code{family =} \code{'gaussian'}) or logistic regression (\code{family =} \code{'binomial'})
#' should be performed
#' @param seed a single number that seeds the random number generator, or \code{NULL} (default, draws own seed).
#' A seed makes the fit reproducible. The function restores the state of the generator when it exits.
#' Note that a seed selects the \code{"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"} generator, which is not the default generator of R.
#' A run with \code{seed =} \code{42} therefore gives different results than a run after \code{set.seed(42)}.
#' @param chains number of MCMC chains (default 4). Each chain draws from its own substream of \code{seed}.
#' Chain \emph{k} depends on \code{seed} and \emph{k} only, so a fit is reproducible whatever \code{cores} is.
#' The chains are pooled before model selection, which therefore selects one model from all draws.
#' @param cores number of processes that run the chains (default \code{getOption("mc.cores", 1)}).
#' \code{cores =} \code{1} runs the chains in this process. A larger value starts that many
#' background processes, which costs about 0.4 seconds each.
#' @param refresh number of iterations between progress lines (default one tenth of the iterations).
#' \code{refresh =} \code{0} stops the progress lines but keeps the elapsed time block.
#' @param silent a single number (default 0). One or more stops every line and the elapsed time
#' block. Multicore fits force silent = 1.
#' @param modelSelection if \code{modelSelection =} \code{'binder'} the final model is selected by minimising the expected posterior binder's loss
#' using an algorithm of Lau and Green (2008) for the spike and slab model and an algorithm of Rastelli and Friel (2016)
#' for the finite mixture approach. Alternatively, \code{modelSelection =} \code{'pam'} can be specified for the sparse finite mixture
#' model. In that case, the final model is selected by using pam clustering and the silhouette coefficient (see Malsiner-Walli et al., 2018 for details).
#' If \code{modelSelection} is \code{NULL} no final model selection is performed and parameter estimates
#' are model averaged results. \code{modelSelection =} \code{'binder'} is the default value. \code{modelSelection =} \code{'pam'}
#' is only available for \code{method =} \code{'FinMix'}. If \code{method =} \code{'SpikeSlab'} and \code{modelSelection =} \code{'pam'},
#' \code{modelSelection} is automatically set to \code{'binder'}. For the finite mixture approach
#' we recommend to use \code{modelSelection =} \code{'binder'}, as this algorithm provides - in contrast to pam clustering and the
#' the silhouette coefficient - the opportunity to exclude whole covariates.
#'
#' @details This function provides identification of categories (of ordinal and nominal predictors) with the
#' same effect on the response and their automatic fusion.
#'
#' Two different prior versions for effect fusion and variable selection are available. The first prior version
#' allows a priori for almost perfect as well as almost zero dependence between level effects. This prior has also
#' an interpretation as independent spike and slab prior on all pairwise differences of level effects and correction
#' for the linear dependence of the effect differences. Even though the prior is mainly designed for fusion of level
#' effects, excluding some categories from the model as well as the whole covariate (variable selection) can also be easily accomplished.
#' Excluding a category from the model corresponds to fusion of this category to the baseline and excluding the whole
#' covariate consequently to fusion of all categories to the baseline.
#'
#' The second prior is a modification of the usual spike and slab prior for the regression coefficients by combining
#' a spike at zero with a finite location mixture of normal components. It enables detection of categories with similar
#' effects on the response by clustering the regression effects. Categories with effects that are allocated to the same
#' cluster are fused. Due to the specification with one component located at zero also automatic exclusion of
#' levels and whole covariates without any effect on the outcome is provided. However, when using \code{modelSelection =} \code{'pam'},
#' it is not possible to exclude whole covariates as the Silhouette coefficient does not allow for one cluster solutions. Therefore,
#' we recommend to use \code{modelSelection =} \code{'binder'}.
#'
#' In settings with large numbers of categories, we recommend to use the sparse finite mixture prior for computational reasons.
#' It is important to note that the sparse finite mixture prior on the level effects does not take into account the ordering information of ordinal
#' predictors and treats them like nominal predictors, whereas in the spike and slab case fusion is restricted to adjacent categories for ordinal predictors.
#'
#' Metric predictors can be included in the model as well and variable selection will be performed also for these predictors.
#'
#' If \code{modelSelection =} \code{NULL}, no final model selection is performed and model averaged results are returned. When \code{modelSelection =} \code{'binder'} the final
#' model is selected by minimizing the expected posterior Binder loss for each covariate separately.
#' Additionally, there is a second option for the finite mixture prior (\code{modelSelection =} \code{'pam'}) which performs model selection
#' by identifying the optimal partition of the effects using PAM clustering and the silhouette coefficient.
#'
#' For comparison purposes it is also possible to fit a full model instead of performing effect fusion (\code{method =} \code{NULL}).
#' All other functions provided in this package, such as \code{\link{dic}} or \code{\link{summary}}, do also work for the full model.
#'
#' Details for the model specification (see arguments):
#' \describe{
#'
#'  \item{\code{prior}}{a list (depending on used \code{method} and specified \code{family}). If \code{method =} \code{NULL}, all prior
#'  specifications are ignored and a flat, uninformative prior is assigned to the level effects\describe{
#'    \item{\code{r}}{variance ratio of slab to spike component; default to 50000 if \code{family =} \code{'gaussian'} and
#'    5000000 if \code{family =} \code{'binomial'}. \code{r} should be chosen not too small but still small enough to avoid stickiness of MCMC. We
#'    recommend a value of at least 20000.}
#'    \item{\code{g0}}{shape parameter of inverse gamma distribution on \eqn{\tau^2} when \code{tau2_fix =} \code{NULL} and \code{method =} \code{'SpikeSlab'}; default
#'    to 5. The default value is a standard choice in variable selection where the tails of spike and slab component are not too thin
#'    to cause mixing problems in MCMC.}
#'    \item{\code{G0}}{scale parameter of inverse gamma distribution on \eqn{\tau^2} when \code{tau2_fix =} \code{NULL} and \code{method =} \code{'SpikeSlab'}; default
#'    to 25. \code{G0} controls to some extend the sparsity of the model. Smaller values for \code{G0} help to detect also small
#'    level effect differences, but result in less fusion of categories.}
#'    \item{\code{tau2_fix}}{If \code{tau2_fix =} \code{NULL}, an inverse gamma hyper-prior is specified on \eqn{\tau^2}.
#'    However, the value of the slab variance can also be fixed for each covariate instead of using a hyperprior.
#'    \code{tau2_fix} is only of interest if \code{method =} \code{'SpikeSlab'}.
#'    Default to \code{NULL}. Similar to the scale parameter \code{G0}, the fixed variance of the slab
#'    component \code{tau2_fix} can control to some extend the sparsity.}
#'    \item{\code{e0}}{parameter of Dirichlet hyper-prior on mixture weights when \code{method =} \code{'FinMix'};
#'    default to 0.01. \code{e0} should be chosen smaller than 1 in order to encourage empty components. Small values such as
#'    0.01 help to concentrate the model space on sparse solutions.}
#'    \item{\code{p}}{prior parameter to control mixture component variances when \code{method =} \code{'FinMix'}; values between 100 and 100000
#'    led to good results in simulation studies; default to 100 if \code{family =} \code{'gaussian'} and 1000 if \code{family =} \code{'binomial'}. We recommend to try different values for this
#'    prior parameter and compare the models using \code{\link{dic}}. When \code{hyperprior =} \code{FALSE}, larger values of \code{p} lead to less sparsity and it should be chosen
#'    not smaller than 100. If a hyper-prior on the mixture component variances is used (\code{hyperprior =} \code{TRUE}), \code{p}
#'    has almost no effect on the sparsity of the model and it should again be not smaller than 100.}
#'    \item{\code{hyperprior}}{logical value if inverse gamma hyper-prior on component variance should be specified when \code{method =} \code{'FinMix'};
#'    default to FALSE. The hyper-prior leads to robust results concerning the specification of \code{p}
#'    but also to very sparse solutions.}
#'    \item{\code{s0}}{hyper-parameter (shape) of inverse gamma distribution on error variance, used for both
#'    versions of \code{method}, but only for \code{family =} \code{'gaussian'}; default to 0.}
#'    \item{\code{S0}}{hyper-parameter (scale) of inverse gamma distribution on error variance, used for both
